# lambotirc

This is my own personal IRC bot. Feel free to use it for your channel. The most
basic usage is
```
Bot(nick, host, port).mainLoop()
```
but most people will want to add personal commands and reactions. See
src/main.py for an example.

## Dependencies

This bot only depends on Python 3 and its standard library.
